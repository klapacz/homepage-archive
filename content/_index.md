Welcome to my website! My name is **Korneliusz Łapacz**. I am eighteen, and I study in high school on IT profile. I am a enthusiast of UNIX like operating systems and [suckless](https://suckless.org) software. Recently I spend more and more time learning Plan9. I do programming as my hobby (mostly web oriented programming…).

As I like minimalist software, big web is not my favorite place. I encourage to check out my [gemini capsule](gemini://lapacz-kornel.dev). I am much more active there.
